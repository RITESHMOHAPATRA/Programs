1. **Longest Region of 1's** -

      Find the highest number of connected 1's in a matrix (we can consider 1's in every direction for adjacency).

2. **Largest sum subarray** -

  Find the subarray in an array whose sum of the elements is maximum.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence** -

  Find the length of the subsequence which is in increasing order in an array.

4. **Min Cost Path** -

  Find the minimum cost to reach from one cell to another where each cell represents the cost of traversing through that cell.
